# Hi, I'm Florian 👋
I'm a **Data Scientist at the Staatsinstitut für Schulqualität und Bildungsforschung (ISB)** with a background in educational research, psychometrics, and large-scale assessment. My work sits at the intersection of data, measurement, and digital feedback systems for schools.

## 🔎 Current Work: Digital Feedback & Reporting Modules
My current main focus is the conceptual and technical development of a **digital feedback module for large-scale assessments** (e.g. VERA):
- Exploring statistical, psychometric, and didactic potentials of assessment data
- Working closely with stakeholders (teachers) to understand needs around usability and interpretability of digital feedback
- Translating pedagogical and statistical requirements into structured requirements and user stories (IREB)
- Contributing to the technical implementation and programming of the feedback module
Overall goal: **clear, cognitively accessible, and pedagogically meaningful feedback** that supports instructional decision-making.
